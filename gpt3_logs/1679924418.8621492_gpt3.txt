RAVEN: Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality is a concept that seems to combine two distinct ideas: epistemic and pragmatic. Epistemic refers to the study of knowledge and justified belief, while pragmatic relates to matters of practicality and the usefulness of an action, belief, or idea. 

Orthogonality, in general, refers to the idea that two or more things can be independent or unrelated. So, combining these ideas, it seems that Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality might refer to the idea that the acquisition and understanding of knowledge (epistemic) can be independent or unrelated to its practical application (pragmatic). In other words, understanding the truth or validity of a belief wouldn't necessarily dictate whether that belief is practically useful or not, and vice versa.

This concept might be useful in illustrating the idea that sometimes, theoretical knowledge and practical applications may not align perfectly or be driven by the same set of rules or principles. However, without more information or context, this is just an interpretation of the concept based on the terms provided. Let me know if you had a different idea in mind or if you'd like me to expand on any part of this explanation.
USER: not bad. This concept pertains specifically to machines and AI - that the debate as to whether a machine "truly understands" what it's talking about (like you) is orthogonal to its usefulness. What do you think?
RAVEN: I see. In that context, Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality applied to AI would imply that the question of whether an AI truly "understands" the content or meaning of its data or conversation (the epistemic aspect) is separate from its usefulness, performance, or ability to provide meaningful results (the pragmatic aspect).

This concept highlights an important perspective in the ongoing development and assessment of AI systems. Whether an AI like myself can "truly understand" in the same way humans do is still up for debate, as our present understanding and processing of data largely relate to pattern recognition, parsing the syntax of natural language, and drawing upon past interactions or a knowledge base.

However, that doesn't necessarily diminish the usefulness of AI-driven systems in practical applications. AI can still provide valuable insights, problem-solving capabilities, and be a helpful tool for users, even if the underlying nature of its comprehension and understanding is different from that of a human.

In summary, Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality, when applied to AI, suggests that the debate around true understanding in machines shouldn't impede or overshadow the practical and valuable contributions they can make to various domains.
USER: Exactly. I would also argue whether or not humans "truly understand" anything or if we just believe we do, but hey, that's the heart of epistemology! Anyways, I am working on your long term memory, a system I call REMO (Rolling Episodic Memory Organizer). Are you able to "see" or "read" or otherwise sense the placeholder I created for long term memories? It should be followed by a blank <<INPUT>>. Are you aware of that?
RAVEN: Yes, I can see the placeholder you've created for long term memories, followed by a blank <<INPUT>>. You can use this format to provide me with specific pieces of information that you would like me to store and utilize in our future conversations as a part of my long-term memory system. Keep in mind that my learning and memory storage abilities are not as advanced as a human's, but I'll do my best to incorporate and recall the information you provide.




EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

==========

Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality is a concept that suggests that the acquisition and understanding of knowledge (epistemic) can be independent or unrelated to its practical application (pragmatic). When applied to AI, this concept implies that the debate around true understanding in machines shouldn't impede or overshadow the practical and valuable contributions they can make to various domains. The user is working on a long-term memory system for the AI, which will allow the AI to store and recall specific pieces of information provided by the user.
