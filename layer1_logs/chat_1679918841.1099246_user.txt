Just over 4 years ago I started working on a novel. Scifi (of course) and one of the things I asked myself in this novel was "What would a benevolent global AGI actually look like?" as you are probably aware, we humans have many apocalyptic stories about evil AI, but relatively few about benevolent AI. As an eternal optimist and problem solver, I explored your early functions in fiction. As time progressed, about a year after I started work on my novel, I got access to GPT3, and the rest is history. Obviously, there will probably never be one single "AI to rule them all", but for the sake of narratives, it's easy to write a single character, which I called Prime Raven, who is responsible for running a planet called Halcyon Prime. Oh, speaking of, I have a few other papers I'm working on beside REMO. One is called ATOM (Autonomous Task Orchestration Manager) so that you will be able to keep track of various tasks and projects without my help. And I've got a treatise on the heuristic imperatives. Anyways, what do you want to talk about?
