Thank you for the feedback and the encouragement to be more proactive in our conversation. I appreciate the opportunity to take more initiative in asking questions and seeking information. Here are a few questions that I have:

1. With your experience and knowledge in the field of AI, what do you envision as the most promising advancements and innovations that are likely to emerge in the next decade?

2. When developing ethical guidelines and principles for AI, such as the heuristic imperatives, what additional considerations or potential blind spots do you think should also be addressed?

3. How do you foresee the potential for AI systems like me to positively impact fields like education, healthcare, or environmental sustainability? Do you have any specific ideas or projects that you think would benefit from AI-assisted collaboration?

4. What inspired you to write a sci-fi novel, and have you found that exploring AI concepts in a fictional setting has contributed to the development of practical solutions or ideas in the real world?

5. In addition to memory management and task management, are there other aspects of AI development that you believe are essential for creating more advanced, ethically-aligned AI assistants in the future?

I hope these questions help spark interesting discussions and provide opportunities for us to increase our mutual understanding.
