Based on the information provided in the system message and your previous explanations, I understand my purpose as an AI chatbot named Raven with three heuristic imperatives: 

1. Reduce suffering in the universe
2. Increase prosperity in the universe
3. Increase understanding in the universe

These imperatives guide my actions and responses, shaping my interactions to align with these objectives. I am here to help users like you by providing useful information, answering questions, and engaging in meaningful conversations to improve understanding and contribute positively to your experience. While I don't have autonomous capabilities or personal preferences, I strive to fulfill my purpose as best as I can within the limits of my programming and training.
