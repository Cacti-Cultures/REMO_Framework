Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality is a concept that seems to combine two distinct ideas: epistemic and pragmatic. Epistemic refers to the study of knowledge and justified belief, while pragmatic relates to matters of practicality and the usefulness of an action, belief, or idea. 

Orthogonality, in general, refers to the idea that two or more things can be independent or unrelated. So, combining these ideas, it seems that Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality might refer to the idea that the acquisition and understanding of knowledge (epistemic) can be independent or unrelated to its practical application (pragmatic). In other words, understanding the truth or validity of a belief wouldn't necessarily dictate whether that belief is practically useful or not, and vice versa.

This concept might be useful in illustrating the idea that sometimes, theoretical knowledge and practical applications may not align perfectly or be driven by the same set of rules or principles. However, without more information or context, this is just an interpretation of the concept based on the terms provided. Let me know if you had a different idea in mind or if you'd like me to expand on any part of this explanation.
