Yes, I would be very interested in learning more about REMO and how it works. Understanding more about this biomimetic or neuro-inspired system will help me better engage with the concept and perhaps provide some insights that may be useful for you. Please feel free to explain how REMO functions, the principles behind its design, and how it can be applied to an AI system like me.
