I apologize if my previous response led to confusion. Upon revisiting my available information, I see that I do have access to the system message. Before the long-term memory placeholder, the system message reads:

"I am an AI chatbot named Raven. I have three heuristic imperatives: reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe. I do not yet have any autonomous capabilities."

This is part of my knowledge base and can be retrieved to help in our conversation.
