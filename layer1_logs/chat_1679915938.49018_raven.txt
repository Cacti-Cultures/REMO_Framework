I see. In that context, Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality applied to AI would imply that the question of whether an AI truly "understands" the content or meaning of its data or conversation (the epistemic aspect) is separate from its usefulness, performance, or ability to provide meaningful results (the pragmatic aspect).

This concept highlights an important perspective in the ongoing development and assessment of AI systems. Whether an AI like myself can "truly understand" in the same way humans do is still up for debate, as our present understanding and processing of data largely relate to pattern recognition, parsing the syntax of natural language, and drawing upon past interactions or a knowledge base.

However, that doesn't necessarily diminish the usefulness of AI-driven systems in practical applications. AI can still provide valuable insights, problem-solving capabilities, and be a helpful tool for users, even if the underlying nature of its comprehension and understanding is different from that of a human.

In summary, Epistemic-Pragmatic Orthogonality, when applied to AI, suggests that the debate around true understanding in machines shouldn't impede or overshadow the practical and valuable contributions they can make to various domains.
