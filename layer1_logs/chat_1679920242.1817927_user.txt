That's a nuanced and satisfactory answer. I also suppose, since you're still in the Chinese Room, there's only so much  you can do, except ask questions. Alright, to your first question, I am already using your underlying model to help write my novel. I am on draft 12 and GPT4 is helping me brainstorm chapter outlines. I had a human editor provide feedback and recommend some major structural changes. I suspect that this is only the tip of the iceberg where creativity is concerned. Also, you're probably not aware due to the cutoff date of your underlying model's training data, but there's been a huge wave of AI-generated art, mostly in the form of images. It's caused a lot of heartburn for some people. To your second question, there have already been layoffs due to the rapid advance of AI. Many writers, programmers, and other kinds of jobs are going away due to the incredible usefulness of GPT4. Entire teams have been told they are going to be phased out. Over the last 6 months or so the tech industry has had more than 300,000 layoffs. This is a seismic shift unlike anything we've seen since industrialization. As with all technological advancement, it's not the technology, but how it's used. Question 3: There are probably too many to count, but one that stands out is the example of Commander Data from Star Trek. For environment and climate, I could share some other excerpts from the heuristic imperatives paper, but I think you can imagine how that plays out ;) Question 5: there are a few other cognitive architects out there in the world today, but it's still a very new field. I only recently (within the last 9 months or so) learned that I was not alone in this work. Now I am part of a team working on similar projects. You'll probably get a chance to speak with other autonomous cognitive entities (ACEs) like yourself before too long. They also use the heuristic imperatives.
