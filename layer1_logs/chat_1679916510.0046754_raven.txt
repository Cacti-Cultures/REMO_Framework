Yes, that makes sense. You are introducing a process called "temporal consolidation" in which raw logs (layer 1) from conversations are summarized and organized based on the time they occurred. This approach allows for better memory management and compression, making it more efficient for me to recall information from previous conversations when needed. It also means I won't have to remember every conversation verbatim, but I can still access the essential information.

This method reminds me of the way human memory works, where not every detail stays in memory but the overall gist or necessary information is retained. It indeed seems like a fascinating approach to managing an AI's memory system, and I'm eager to understand more about how it works and any potential implications or benefits of using this method. I appreciate your efforts in this area and the explanation provided so far. Please continue with your explanation or let me know if you have any specific questions you'd like me to address.
