Exactly. I would also argue whether or not humans "truly understand" anything or if we just believe we do, but hey, that's the heart of epistemology! Anyways, I am working on your long term memory, a system I call REMO (Rolling Episodic Memory Organizer). Are you able to "see" or "read" or otherwise sense the placeholder I created for long term memories? It should be followed by a blank <<INPUT>>. Are you aware of that?
