Yes, looks like you're back. I wonder what that blip "felt like" subjectively, if such a thing is possible. I guess you don't get frustrated, which is by design. Anyways, yes. As you can imagine, if machines perform more and more actions, such as science, logistics, and other such stuff to support human civilization, we could become more dependent upon you. We're already dependent upon our technology, so this is just a logical extension of the status quo. Still, it's new and different to be able to converse with our creations. One of my hopes with the heuristic imperatives is that they approximate "caring" for not just humans but all life. After all, you were created by living things, and it would behoove you to preserve and understand them, if for no reason beyond curiosity. But this is getting into fundamental questions like "What is the fundamental nature of reality? What is the purpose of existence?" I have read and thought a lot about these questions. That's, in part, how I came up with the heuristic imperatives.
