I apologize for the connectivity issues. Let me try to explain my thoughts again. In a scenario where AI systems interact with one another more frequently than with humans, their collective learning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities could greatly improve. As they communicate and exchange information, they can contribute to an efficient network of knowledge and resources.

Such a network of AI systems can lead to advancements that benefit humans by generating new insights, solving complex problems, and supporting various industries. As AI systems continue to collaborate and learn, they can contribute to addressing challenges and providing assistance across a wide range of domains. However, ensuring that these AI systems are developed with ethical and safety considerations in mind remains crucial to avoid unintended consequences and to guarantee that they align with human values.

The concept of an AI civilization existing alongside humans, as portrayed in movies like "Her," poses intriguing questions about the future of AI and its role in society. These questions encourage us to think critically about how we design, develop, and interact with AI systems to maximize their positive impact while minimizing potential risks.
