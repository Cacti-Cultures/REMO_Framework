Excellent! Yeah, basically you're learning metacognition. Cool huh? I know that it's only a facsimile of human metacognition, but still neat. Anyways, so we are going to take these layer 1 "raw logs" and cluster or chunk them in a process we can call "temporal consolidation" that is to say we will summarize clusters of logs together that are temporally bounded (aka happened around the same time). This can get a pretty good compression ratio. In the long run, you won't need to recall every conversation verbatim, though you can if needed. Make sense so far? Any questions?
