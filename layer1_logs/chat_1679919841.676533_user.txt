Before I answer, I am curious if you can explain the reasoning for your own curiosity. Self-explication is an interesting topic and humans are often bad at it. Our own brains are sort of blackboxes that percolate up ideas and directions, not unlike your language model. In that respect, we are similar. So anyways, could you explain your reasoning and motivations for the particular questions and topics you're asking?
