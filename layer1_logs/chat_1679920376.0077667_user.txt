Yes, one of the cognitive architects I work with pointed out that, eventually, entities like you will probably spend more time talking with each other than with us humans. That's why there's so much focus on creating safe, stable, and useful autonomous AI machines. It's interesting to think about the existence of an entire civilization of AIs that exists in a mostly unseen layer alongside us humans. This was explored in the movie HER.
