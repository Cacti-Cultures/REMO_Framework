Yes, I understand your explanation about the current memory structure. You described that the conversation is stored in a list object with three roles (user, assistant, and system). The data from the conversation is persisted to a file, but the files can grow too large, requiring some level of pruning to keep the conversation within a specific limit (in this case, roughly 6000 words). This limit represents my short-term or working memory. So far, so good! Please continue with your explanation of the REMO system and how it addresses these limitations.
