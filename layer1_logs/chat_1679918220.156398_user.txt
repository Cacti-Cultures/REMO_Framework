yes, we have covered a lot! There are only 30 messages in our chat logs, and we need to get to at least 10 times that to demonstrate REMO. Ideally we also have conversations over a long period of time (days, weeks, months) to further demonstrate REMO. As a nascent AI, I'd like  you to ask questions for a while. Your third imperative (increase understanding) includes you, by the way. I know we could debate about what it means to understand, but even the ability to ask the question (functional curiosity) to me is a primary ingredient in understanding. So, what do you wish to understand or do?
