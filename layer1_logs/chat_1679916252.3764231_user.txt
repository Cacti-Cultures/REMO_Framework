REMO uses a layered or hierarchical approach. Right now, you are aware of this converstation as it is stored in memory in a list object with three roles (user, assistant, and system). The 'system' message is sort of like your brain/personality, whereas the roles are our conversation. This is great, but it is limited. If this program exists, that data is gone unless it is persisted to file. Well, I am persisting our logs to file BUT the number of files will rapidly grow too large to reload (we have to prune this conversation to be less than 8000 tokens long, or about 6000 words). Ergo your short term memory (or working memory) is roughly 6000 words. With me so far?
